### Decision tree

- Decision tree algorithm falls under the category of supervised learning. They can be used to solve both regression and classification problems.
- Decision tree uses the tree representation to solve the problem in which each leaf node corresponds to a class label and attributes are represented on the internal node of the tree.
- We can represent any boolean function on discrete attributes using the decision tree.
